•  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
It tells git to not track some files and folders that we don’t want to upload to our master repository. 
We do this to reduce complexity and avoid unwanted merge conflicts.

Content from .gitignore file :
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml
hs_err_pid*

•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
Basically, a branch and master are pointing at the same commit, and let's say we work and make commits in the branch. 
So the branch is pointing to the latest commit made and now we want to merge master and branch. This will be done 
linearly, as all git will do is change the pointer of master towards/forward. This process simply means fast-forward.


•  Why should you have different branches? 
By making a branch of the master we can separately work on our own features without disturbing the functioning of the 
master branch. Helps team members to work & test their own features.


•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
Multiple remote.
